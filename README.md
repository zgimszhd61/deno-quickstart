## Getting Started with Deno

Deno is a modern runtime for JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly that aims to provide a secure and efficient development experience. Here's a quick start guide to help you get started with Deno:

### Installation

1. **Install Deno**: You can install Deno using the following commands based on your operating system:

   - macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
     ```

   - Windows (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex
     ```

   After installation, you should have the `deno` command available in your terminal.[1]

### Creating a Simple Web Server

1. **Create a file**: Create a new file called `server.ts` with the following content:

   ```typescript
   import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.182.0/http/server.ts";

   const server = serve({ port: 8000 });
   console.log("Server running on http://localhost:8000");

   for await (const req of server) {
     req.respond({ body: "Hello, Deno!" });
   }
   ```

   This code imports the `serve` function from the Deno standard library and creates a simple web server that listens on port 8000 and responds with "Hello, Deno!" for every request.[2][6]

2. **Run the server**: In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `server.ts` file and run the following command:

   ```bash
   deno run --allow-net server.ts
   ```

   The `--allow-net` flag is required to grant network access to the Deno program. You should see the "Server running on http://localhost:8000" message in the terminal.[2]

3. **Visit the server**: Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the "Hello, Deno!" message displayed.

### Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully set up Deno and created your first web server. Here are some additional resources to help you continue learning Deno:
